				        Real Gross Domestic Product Trends of Metropolitan Stastical Areas in the Midwestern United States.
				    </h1>
						<p>
							Featuring an interactive map displaying real GDP, this website was designed to help the user think about and
							understand the economies of the most highly populated Metropolitan Stastical Areas in the Midwestern United States from 2001 to 2018.
							An area is considered a part of a <b>Metropolitan Stastical Areas(MSA)</b> if it consists, "of the county or counties (or equivalent entities) associated with at
							least one urbanized area of at least 50,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through
							commuting ties."(United States Census Bureau). The <b>Midwest region</b> of the United States consists of 12 states; Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
							Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). Understanding <b>economics
							of MSAs</b> in the Midwest states is important because it can explain, "how people, businesses, and governments respond to their economic
							environments. Many of the issues that fill the newspapers — jobs, wages, taxes, the cost of living, inequality, pollution, poverty, and
							economic growth — are, in fundamental ways, economic issues. The daily decisions of businesses and consumers are largely
							economic" (University of Wisconsin - Madison).
						</p>
						<p>
							This site uses real GDP to examine economic trends. GDP must be understood before understanding real GDP. "<b>Gross
							Domestic Product(GDP)</b> is one of the "vital signs" used to measure the health of a nation’s economy. GDP measures the market
							value of the goods and services produced in a country. It’s used to measure and compare economies around the world" (Bureau
							of Economic Analysis). Now that GDP is understood, "<b>Real GDP</b> by metropolitan area is an inflation-adjusted measure of each
							area's gross product that is based on national prices for the goods and services produced within the area" (Bureau of
							Economic Analysis). In the interactive map below, a user can examine and compare real GDP for cities predominantly associated
							with MSAs in the Midwest region of the United States.
